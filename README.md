# User Workspace

## Project Overview
User Workspace is a simple web application framework built using Node.js and Express. It provides a structured way to build server-side applications by offering middleware functionalities like parsing request bodies and handling CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing).

## Installation
To get started with User Workspace, you'll need to have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed on your machine. Once Node.js is installed, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/user-workspace.git
   cd user-workspace
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

## Usage
After installing the dependencies, you can run the application using the following command:

```bash
node index.js
```

Make sure to replace `index.js` with the entry point of your application if it's named differently.

You can then access the application at `http://localhost:3000` or the port defined within your application settings.

## Features
- **Middleware Support:** Built-in middleware for handling JSON requests, URL-encoded data, etc.
- **CORS Handling:** Support for handling CORS requests with the `cors` package.
- **Routing:** Easy routing functionality through Express.

User Workspace requires the following dependencies, as listed in `package.json`:

- **body-parser:** ^2.2.0 - Middleware for parsing request bodies.
